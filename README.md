# Layoffs Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data cleaning in MySQL
Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting inaccuracies to ensure data quality, aiding in accurate decision-making and analysis. Benefits of data cleaning include increased productivity, data reliability, and reduced risk of skewed analytics, which are pivotal for optimal business decision-making.In this project, we aim to clean layoff data in , company, industry,  country, and more.

## Cleaning Process
In order to perform data analysis in the most efficient way, data sets must be clean.
Here are the steps we took in the cleaning process:

- **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate entries to maintain data integrity and avoid redundancy.
- **Standardizing Data**: Ensured uniformity in data format and structure for easy analysis.
- **Handling Null Values and Blanks**: Addressed missing or incomplete data points by either filling in the gaps or removing them as necessary.
- **Removing Columns and Rows**: Streamlined the dataset by removing irrelevant columns and rows that do not contribute to our analysis objectives.
