# Layoffs Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data cleaning in MySQL
Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting inaccuracies to ensure data quality, aiding in accurate decision-making and analysis. Benefits of data cleaning include increased productivity, data reliability, and reduced risk of skewed analytics, which are pivotal for optimal business decision-making.In this project, we aim to clean layoff data in , company, industry,  country, and more.

## Cleaning Process
In order to perform data analysis in the most efficient way, data sets must be clean.
Here are the steps we took in the cleaning process:

- **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate entries to maintain data integrity and avoid redundancy.
- **Standardizing Data**: Ensured uniformity in data format and structure for easy analysis.
- **Handling Null Values and Blanks**: Addressed missing or incomplete data points by either filling in the gaps or removing them as necessary.
- **Removing Columns and Rows**: Streamlined the dataset by removing irrelevant columns and rows that do not contribute to our analysis objectives.


## Exploratory Data Analysis
We are going to analyze layoffs in companies . Data was obtained from companies in 51 different countries, which took place between 2020 and 2023.The analysis of layoffs in this dataset was done using many functions with MySQL. The results obtained are indicated with explanation lines. For more and detailed information, you can check below.
